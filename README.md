# YUMI
Your universal Multiboot Installer

 * YUMI is a "create-boot-usb-sticks" for windows, which supports
dozens of linux distros and automatically downloads the isos for you.

 * After YUMI has put an OS on it, the usb stick is still usable to store files
and everything else.

 * This is why I like this software and created this repo. 
 * There is a windows and a linux version. 

 * It turns out the Windows version consists of .nsh files which belong to the "Nullsoft Scriptable Installer System". 
   * Which is (I think) absolutely horrible and strange syntax.

 * The linux version (not part of this repo) is written in gambas a visual-basic-for-linux language :p

# Notes

 * Yumi is free software (GPL) \o/
 * There seems to be no git repo, only the source code in a zip file
   This is why I created this repo.
